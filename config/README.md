# Config

This folder contains configuration for building the project. This includes any task-runners needed for the project.

* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/)

Project specific configuration should go into `./config.js`.

## Testing

The `./test.config.js` bootstraps your test harness. Be sure to `require` any dependent angular libraries.
